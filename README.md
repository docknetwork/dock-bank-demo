# Dock Sales Demo

## Overview

The Dock Sales Demo showcases the integration of KYC, biometric services, and verifiable credentials to demonstrate the capabilities of Dock's API and wallet. It simulates a customer journey through KYC verification, credential issuance, and verification across various scenarios, emphasizing integration ease and user experience.

## Quotient Wallet

This demo is designed to work with the demo Quotient Credit Union wallet app. Please install it for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/quotient-wallet/id6473549219) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=labs.dock.quotient).

### Workflow Steps

1. 🚀 User initiates the KYC process.
2. 🔒 Biometric verification is conducted by scanning a QR code.
3. ✅ Upon successful verification, the user is issued verifiable credentials.
4. 🔍 The user presents the credentials for verification.


## 🎮 Running the Project

### 📓Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed.
- Dock account with API access.

### 🔑 Configuration

### 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repo: `git clone <repo_url>`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn`

### Configuring Certs Dependencies

Running this project depends on having an ecosystem, organizational profiles, and proof request templates configured properly in Certs. You can set these up automatically by using the [setup-certs](./scripts/setup-certs.mjs) command. To run it, follow these steps:

1. Configure the `.env` file by setting the following variables
    * DOCK_API_KEY - sign into [Certs](https://certs.dock.io/) and generate a test environment key from `Developer -> API Keys`
    * DOCK_API_URL=DOCK_API_URL="https://api-testnet.dock.io"
2. Run `yarn setup-certs`
3. This will generate a `.env.new` file populated with the environment variables you need to run the project. Copy this over the `.env` file

For reference the details about the ecosystem and some sample JSON request bodies can be found in the [data/ecosystem-requests](./data/ecosystem-requests/) folder.

## 🧪 Testing the Project Workflow

Before starting, remember to get the Dock Wallet mobile app, with the biometric service plugin enabled, is required. The Dock Wallet app is available on PlayStore or AppStore.

The demo workflow consists of going through the KYC process filling the formularies and scanning each QR code to get authenticated and test the organizations ecosystems.

It's based on an ecosystem called, "Clarity Partners". The ecosystem contains the following organizations:

**Quotient Credit Union:** Create BankId and Credit Score credentials and Apply for an auto loan.

**Equinet:** Create and revoke Credit Score credential and issue a new one.

**Urbanscape:** Apply for an apartment providing your BankId and Credit Score credentials.

**1. Create a Bank account:** On the main page organizations click on “New Bank Account” from Quotient.

Fill the formulary required data and click on “Submit Application”. This will take you to the first QR code we need to scan with the Dock Wallet app using the option “Scan”. This QR code will trigger the biometric verification process on the mobile to get the Biometric credential.

Once QR code verification is successful, you will receive 2 credentials in your Dock Wallet, “Credit Score credential” and “BankId credential”.

**2. Obtain Auto Loan:** On the main page click on “Obtain Auto Loan” from Quotient.

Identify yourself scanning the QR code using your Dock Wallet app and select the required credentials: Biometric, BankId, and Credit Score.

On verification success will automatically fill the fields “First Name, Last Name, Street Address”, from your BankId credential details, then click on “Submit Application” to continue.

On the success page, you will find a second QR code to scan with the Dock Wallet to proof your Credit Score from your credential.

**3. Revoke & Reissue Credit Score:** On the main page click on “Visit Site” from Equinet. This page is the representation of a Credit Score credential history. You can revoke the actual Credit Score credential and issue another with one action. Click on “Revoke and Issue New credential” to test the functionality. Note: you need to complete previous steps to own this credential and revoke it.

**4. Apply for an apartment:** On the main page click on “Visit Site” from Urbanscape. Identify yourself scanning the QR code using your Dock Wallet app and select the required credentials: Biometric, BankId, and Credit Score. 

On verification success will automatically fill the fields “First Name, Last Name, Street Address”, from your BankId credential details, then click on “Submit Application” to continue.

On the success page, you will find a second QR code to scan and proof your Credit Score from your credential.

With this, we finish the workflow from the application where we can have an overview of some usage of the decentralized identity and credentials management.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `/pages/api` - Server side API integration and communication with Dock.
- `/pages/org` - Organization pages for testing functionality.
- `/components/ui` - Interface components from ShadCn library.
- `/_credentials` - Credential Schemas used for issuing credentials.
- `/hooks` - Handle QR generation and verification and revoke credentials. 
- `/store` - State management for user information and Qr code Status.
- `/utils` - Utility functions for API and server side communication for credentials and qr code.

Note: Most of the functions are documented inside of each file.

## Main Functions & Methods

### State management 

The Qr code state is handle by `/store/qrCodeStore.js` folder, using the Zustand library, for updating the proof template Id and verification state.
Qr code track this states: 

    proofTemplateId -> Dock Cert Verification template id

    qrCodeUrl -> Generated url from generateQR() function

    proofID -> Unique Id for each Qr code generated

    isLoading -> Boolean for loading code generation 

    verified -> Is verified by user, default to false

    verificationError -> Boolean state for error handling

    retrievedData -> Credential data retrieved when is verified

Each value also contain setter function.

### Main Functions

Under folder `/utils` are the files that handle all the communication with Dock API service.

`createRegistry(policyDid, type)` -> Creates Registry for a new credential.

`createCredential(registryId, credential)` -> Create new credential from registryId & credential schema.

`distributeCredential(credential)` -> Send a signed credential to a Did or email.        

`issueRevokableCredential = async (credential, setRevokableCredential)` -> Entire process that carrie all previews functions.
revokeCredential = async (registryId, credentialId) -> Revoke credit score credential with a given registry and credential ids.
    

### Methods

There is 3 important methods under `/hooks` folder wich make the application workflow:

`useQrCode = ({ proofTemplateId })` -> 
The useQrCode hook orchestrates the generation of QR codes associated with proof requests. It leverages state management through qrCodeStore, handling loading states, verification flags, and potential errors. Upon calling handleGenerateQR, it sets up the necessary parameters, initiates QR code creation via handleCreateQr, and updates relevant states accordingly.

`useVerifyProof = ()` -> 
This React hook, useVerifyProof, facilitates verifying proof requests tied to a QR code. It utilizes intervals to periodically check the verification status. Upon successful verification, it updates relevant states, such as user DID, verification status, and retrieved data. In case of errors, it handles retries and sets a verification error flag.

### Main Component

`QrCodeAuthentication`

Hooks methods are use in single component `components/qrcode/qr-auth.jsx` with two responsabilities, generate and verify a Qr code using the previews hooks `useQrCode` & `useVerifyProof`.

The `QrCodeAuthentication` component manages QR code authentication flow. It renders UI elements conditionally based on whether the QR code is verified or not. If not verified, it displays QR code verification UI provided by VerifyQrCode component along with optional descriptive texts before and after. Upon verification, it shows a refresh icon to allow users to retry the authentication process. Additionally, it lists required credentials using CredentialCards component.
